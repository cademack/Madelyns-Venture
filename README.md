Lua-based game using LÖVE's engine. Intended to build experience with Github and creative coding. 

If you're unfamilar with LÖVE, the games can be run by dragging the folder containing the main.lua and conf.lua files onto the LÖVE shortcut. The LÖVE application can be downloaded for free from the website, it's pretty neat.
